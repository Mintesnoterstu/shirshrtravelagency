Carved entirely from solid rock in the 12th and 13th centuries, these 11 churches represent one of the world's most remarkable architectural achievements. Bete Maryam, the most beautiful church, features stunning frescoes and is believed to be the first church built by King Lalibela. Bete Golgotha, the royal burial church, contains the tombs of King Lalibela and several Ethiopian kings. The iconic Bete Giyorgis (Church of St. George) is carved in the shape of a cross and stands as the most famous symbol of Lalibela. All churches are connected by an intricate network of underground tunnels and trenches, creating a spiritual labyrinth that continues to inspire pilgrims and visitors from around the world."

As the capital of the mighty Aksumite Kingdom (1st–7th century AD), this UNESCO World Heritage Site was once one of the four great powers of the ancient world, alongside Rome, Persia, and China. Today, its towering obelisks, underground tombs, and sacred relics whisper tales of a civilization that dominated trade routes from Africa to Asia. Marvel at the 1,700-year-old stelae fields, where 30-story granite spires (some weighing 160 tons!) mark royal tombs. Visit the Church of St. Mary of Zion, which claims to safeguard the Ark of the Covenant—the golden chest holding the original Ten Commandments. Explore the Dungur Palace, widely believed to be the home of the legendary Queen of Sheba (Makeda), and descend into King Bazen's 2,000-year-old royal crypt with ancient Sabaean inscriptions."

Today, its UNESCO-listed palaces, ornate churches, and vibrant festivals make it a crown jewel of Ethiopia's Historic Route. Step into a 17th-century fortress-city with six majestic castles, including Fasilides' Palace with its turreted towers and banquet halls, Iyasu's Castle famous for its mirrored throne room once lined with ivory and gold, and Dawit's Hall where emperors held court beneath frescoed ceilings. Every January, Gondar becomes the epicenter of Timkat, Ethiopia's Orthodox celebration of Jesus' baptism, where thousands gather at Fasilides' Bath for sacred bathing rituals. Visit Debre Berhan Selassie Church to gaze up at 135 cherubic faces painted on the wooden beams—Ethiopia's most famous frescoes."

This otherworldly landscape of dramatic escarpments, sheer cliffs, and rolling highland plateaus plunges down nearly 1,500 meters in places, creating one of the continent's most spectacular trekking destinations. Home to endemic wildlife, traditional villages, and some of the continent's most breathtaking vistas, the Simiens offer an adventure that's both physically challenging and spiritually uplifting. Conquer Ethiopia's highest peak at 4,543 meters on a multi-day expedition to Ras Dashen, or take the park's signature hike from Geech to Imet Gogo leading to 360-degree viewpoints over 100km of jagged peaks. Observe hundreds of gelada monkeys as they socialize on cliff edges, spot the world's rarest canid (Ethiopian wolves) hunting rodents on the Sanetti Plateau, and see endangered Walia ibex scale near-vertical cliffs with supernatural ease. Experience traditional Tigrayan hospitality in the village of Geech and marvel at the park's most famous 360° panorama at Imet Gogo."

      "description": "Carved into a sheer 300-meter cliff in Tigray's Gheralta Mountains, the 5th-century Abuna Yemata Guh offers breathtaking frescoes untouched by time, a heart-pounding ascent with no safety ropes, and spiritual rewards beyond imagination. Experience a 1.5-hour climb using hand-carved footholds, a final 10-meter vertical stretch requiring barefoot climbing, dome frescoes of the Nine Saints and 12 Apostles, ancient manuscripts sealed in leather pouches, and perfect acoustics for liturgical chanting with panorama across Tigray's sandstone formations."
